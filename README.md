# 📈 Nifty 50 Stock Market Analysis
### A Data-Driven Exploration of NIFTY Index Trends and Market Behavior

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes historical **Nifty 50 index** data to understand price fluctuations, volatility patterns, and long-term market behavior. It includes **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, visualizations**, and **time-series forecasting using the ARIMA model**.

The project is intended as a learning and research exercise.

---

## 🧠 Objectives
- Explore historical Nifty 50 price trends  
- Visualize market movement and volatility  
- Calculate daily & monthly returns  
- Understand rolling trends and seasonality  
- Apply time-series forecasting with ARIMA  
- Evaluate predictive accuracy and identify improvements

## 📊 Key Insights & Forecasting
The project implements an **ARIMA time-series forecasting model** to predict future closing prices.

However, due to the highly volatile nature of stock market data, the model performance was **not highly accurate**, and **forecasting error remained significant**.  
This highlights the need for **more advanced or hybrid models** to capture complex market behavior.

## 🔮 Future Improvements
To enhance prediction accuracy in upcoming iterations, the following models will be explored:

- **SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)**
- **Prophet Model by Meta**
- **LSTM / GRU Neural Networks**
- **Hybrid Machine Learning + Statistical Models**
- **Feature engineering with sentiment / macroeconomic indicators**
